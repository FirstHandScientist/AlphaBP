# Alpha Belief Propagation

## Theory Part
For development, please read [analysis for alpha BP](./manuscript/README.md).

## Environment
Create a virtual environment with a python2 interpreter at 'path/to/your/evn/'
```bash
$ virtualenv -p python2.7 pyenv27
```
(Here python2.7 is required due to src/factorgraph.py was developed in python2.7)
Then activate your environment:

``` bash
$ source path/to/your/evn/pyenv27/bin/activate
```
and install the requirement file:

``` bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```
